		// Object is an instance of a class.
		// Object is a real world entity such as pen, laptop, mobile, bed,
		// keyboard, mouse, chair etc.
		// Object is a physical entity.
		// Object is created through new keyword mainly e.g.
		// Student s1=new Student();
		// Object is created many times as per requirement.
		// Object allocates memory when it is created.
		// There are many ways to create object in java such as new keyword,
		// newInstance() method, clone() method, factory method and
		// deserialization.
		//

		System.out.println("Class");

		// Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.
		// Class is a group of similar objects.
		// Class is a logical entity.
		// Class is declared using class keyword e.g.
		// class Student{}
		// Class is declared once.
		// Class doesn't allocated memory when it is created.
		// There is only one way to define class in java using class keyword.
